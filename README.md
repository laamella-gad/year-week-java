# Year-Week-Java

A class for dealing with week numbers in Java.

# Why?

Because I haven't found any correct source of information on how to deal with weeknumbers correctly without using
[YearWeek in ThreeTen Extra](https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/YearWeek.html) 

If, for some reason, you can't use that library, take a look at this one.

Go ahead and copy the class or whatever you want.
